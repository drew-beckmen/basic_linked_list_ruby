Linked List
==============

In this repository, I am practicing my basic Ruby object oriented programming skills in order to implement the linked list data structure. 

## Deliverables

- ```Linked List``` class and a ```Node``` class. 
- Operations available to ```Linked List``` class are:
  - append (to the end of the list, taking in a value)
  - append_after (taking in a target and a value)
  - delete (taking in a value)
  - empty? returns whether or not the linked list is empty
  - ```#.to_s``` method to print out the entire linked list
- ```Linked List``` will have two instance variables, @head and @tail, both of which are of type ```Node```
- Operations available to ```Node```
  - ```#initialize``` method that takes a value as parameter
  - ```#.to_s``` method to create a readable string representation of a Node
- ```Node``` will have to instance variables: a value and a pointer to the following node
